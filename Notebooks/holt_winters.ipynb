    "# Holt-Winters\n",
    "The Holt-Winters model is a predictive/filtering model that helps estimate future data using three terms: a n average term, a trend term, and a seasonal term.\n",
    "It only requires the variable itself over time, which is why it is so useful as few independent variables are needed. Only requiring past data is a pro and a con: think of reasons why!\n",

    "<summary>Pros/Cons</summary>\n",
    "Possible pros: reduced noise from useless IV, simplicity, less data collection<br><br>\n",
    "Possible cons: captures correlation not causation, slower to react to changes, can't predict based on changes in true underlying variables\n",
    "</details>\n",

    "Now, we will go into the actual implementation and build up a logical foundation. We'll start by explaining the problem, and slowly build up to the full Holt-Winters model!"
